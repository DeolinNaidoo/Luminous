## Features

**Luminous** is designed to enhance your Obsidian experience, with a number of changes to the interface, layout, and typography. Key features include:

- **Customizable neon accent colors** for a vibrant and dynamic appearance.
- **Improved element spacing, sizing, and positioning** for a more consistent and enjoyable editing experience.
- **The window minimize/maximize/close button icons have been replaced** with those from the [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) icons toolkit, giving a smoother and more modern look.
- **The sidebar toggle button** has been accented and the surrounding borders have been simplified and rounded for a cleaner design.
- **Code block handling**:
  - **Long code lines overflow and are scrolled horizontally** instead of wrapping onto the next line.
  - Code blocks are styled to maintain contrast and readability.
- **Images are slightly rounded, headings are underlined**, and callout arrows are right-aligned.
- **Checkboxes are circular** with completed tasks greyed out instead of crossed out. Alternative checkbox styles include:
  - **`- [/]`** for incomplete tasks (half-filled circle).
  - **`- [-]`** for cancelled tasks (crossed out).
